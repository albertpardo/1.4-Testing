## 📄 Description - Exercise Statement

This is the fourth task for **Sprint 1 Java Language** in the **Backend Java Course** in ITAcademy (Barcelona, Spain).
There are 3 levels with exercises.

## Level 1: JUnit

### Exercise 1

Create a Java class that manages a collection of books in a library. The class should allow adding books, retrieving the list of books, obtaining a specific book by its position, adding a book at a specific position, and removing a book by title.

Implement the following functionalities:

-   The class should allow adding books to the collection.
-   The complete list of books should be retrievable.
-   The title of a book should be obtainable given a position.
-   A book should be addable at a specific position.
-   A book should be removable by title.

Verify its correct functionality with JUnit:

-   Ensure that the book list is not null after creating a new object.
-   Confirm that the list has an expected size after inserting several books.
-   Ensure that the list contains a specific book in its correct position.
-   Verify that there are no duplicate book titles in the list.
-   Confirm that the title of a book can be retrieved given a specific position.
-   Ensure that adding a book correctly modifies the list.
-   Confirm that removing a book decreases the size of the list.
-   Verify that the list remains alphabetically ordered after adding or removing a book.

### Exercise 2

-   Create a class titled CalculateDni that calculates the letter of the DNI when given the number as a parameter.
-   Create a JUnit class that verifies its correct functionality by parameterizing it to receive a broad data spectrum and validate whether the calculation is correct for 10 predefined DNI numbers.

### Exercise 3

-   Create a class with a method that throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
-   Verify its correct functionality with a JUnit test.

## Level 2: AssertJ

Create Java classes and/or tests that demonstrate the following:

### Exercise 1

An assertion that demonstrates that the value of two integer objects is equal, and another that indicates that it is not.

### Exercise 2

An assertion that demonstrates that a reference to an object is the same as another one, and another that indicates it is different.

### Exercise 3

An assertion that indicates that two arrays of integers are identical.

### Exercise 4

Create an ArrayList that contains various types of objects (create them as well). Write an assertion to verify the order of objects in the ArrayList according to how they were inserted.

-   Now verify that the previous list contains the objects in any order.
-   Verify that, in the previous list, one of the objects has been added only once. Leave one of the elements unadded and check that the list does not contain this last one.

### Exercise 5

Create a map and verify that it contains one of the keys added to it.

### Exercise 6

Cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in any class. Create an assertion that validates that the exception is thrown when appropriate.

### Exercise 7

Create an empty Optional object. Write the correct assertion to verify that it is indeed empty.
